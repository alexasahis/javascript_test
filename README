JavaScript testing plugin
=========================

This plugin provides the script.aculo.us JavaScript unit testing framework
in way that integrates with Rails applications.

Usage
=====

Use the provided generator to built a skeleton for your JavaScript test.
The built-in rake task can then be used to automatically run the unit tests
in various installed browsers (supported are Firefox on IE/Mac/Linux, 
Safari on Mac, Konqueror on Linux).

Note that due to the built-in webrick, you don't have to change anything
about your app, just add tests. :)

Example
=======

Generate a JavaScript test skeleton for your public/javascripts/foo.js file:

script/generate javascript_test foo

Run the unit tests (a "assertTruth" dummy test is provided, so you should see
"SUCCESS" messages):

rake test:javascripts

You'll find more info on how to write tests on the script.aculo.us wiki:
